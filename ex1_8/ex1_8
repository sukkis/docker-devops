Task: In this exercise we won’t create a new Dockerfile. Image devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise has instructions to create a log into /usr/app/logs.txt. Start the container with bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem. Submit your used commands for this exercise.

Command that worked:

[p@nixos :~/code/docker/ex1_8] λ:  docker run -it -v $(pwd)/logs.txt:/usr/app/logs.txt devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise
(node:1) ExperimentalWarning: The fs.promises API is experimental
Wrote to file /usr/app/logs.txt
Wrote to file /usr/app/logs.txt
Wrote to file /usr/app/logs.txt

First try resulted in an error message. It expected logs.txt to be a directory instead of a file. Fix: touch logs.txt . Then when running the command again it worked fine.

And the secret:
p@nixos~/c/d/ex1_8> tail -f logs.txt
