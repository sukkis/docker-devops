First Dockerfile:
"
  FROM devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise

  CMD [‚Äù/bin/bash"]
"

Improved Dockerfile:
"
  FROM devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise
  COPY clock.sh /usr/app/
  ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "/usr/app/clock.sh"]
"

The alternative clock code in improved Docker file (clock.sh):
"
  #!/bin/bash
  while true; do TZ="Europe/Helsinki" date +%H:%M:%S; sleep 1; clear; done
"
Command to run container:
"docker run -it docker-clock"

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
In the Dockerfile you can provide a CMD that has default arguments that would suit the original code. E.g. CMD ["-c","212322"]. This would havelead to situation where this number is incremented every second. But it would not really be a clock.

You could combo the previous with copying an improved index.js on top of the original one. Like "COPY index.js /usr/app/", so that the individual function that is supposed to be a clock is fixed.
